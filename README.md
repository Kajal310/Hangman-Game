# Hangman Game
This is a very famous game played by everyone wherein you have to guess a word ( spelling ). You are given 5 tries and you have to guess the correct word , you will be only given the number of spaces and it keeps on updating the correct guesses you give.
I have used length function and for loops in order to keep the number of dashes and also the loops for updating the correct words in the blank
